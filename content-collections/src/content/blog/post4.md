## Advanced Techniques in Astro for Optimized Performance

## Introduction

Astro's architecture is designed for performance, but there are advanced techniques you can use to further optimize your static sites. This post will cover some of these techniques.

## Code Splitting

Astro automatically splits your JavaScript by page. To leverage this:
- Ensure components are loaded only where needed.
- Use dynamic imports for large libraries.

## Image Optimization

Optimize images using the built-in Astro Image component or external tools like ImageMagick.
```javascript
import { Image } from '@astrojs/image';
```

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Astro supports SSR for pages that require dynamic data.
    ```javascript
    // src/pages/ssr.astro
    ---
    export async function getStaticProps() {
    const data = await fetchData();
    return { props: { data } };
    }
    ---
```

## Caching Strategies

Use service workers and caching strategies to improve load times.
- Implement a service worker to cache assets.
- Use CDN for static assets.

## Conclusion

By using these advanced techniques, you can push the performance of your Astro sites even further, providing a better user experience.
